## Information 

### About me

After graduation from the university, I had been on maternity leave for two years and when finished I got an office manager position at the IT outsource company. Getting to know IT sphere much better during that time I was enchanted by the incredible job of frontend developers, because they are the ones closest to clients in web (except for support team). They visualize data from backend in the way designers want them and adjust sites due to users experience. One way or another FE-developers are the center of any project. 

My global goal is making websites accessible, convenient to use and well-perfomanced using my frontend skills. I am a fast learner, who has both logic and empathy to obtain all hard and soft skills the Universe of Frontend needs me to.

    return result;
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {

      result += i;
    }
  }
  return result;
